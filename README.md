# Simple UTC Daemon

A lightweight, high-performance UTC (Universal Time Coordinate) daemon written in C++.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for low-latency time synchronization
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Configurable**: Flexible configuration options
- **Secure**: Built with security best practices
- **Containerized**: Full Docker support for development and deployment

## Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build for all platforms
./scripts/build-docker.sh -d all

# Run the UTC daemon
docker-compose --profile runtime up simple-utcd

# Development environment
docker-compose --profile dev up dev
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
make deps

# Build the project
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Install
make install
```

## Help System

The project includes a comprehensive modular help system:

```bash
# Quick reference
make help

# Complete reference
make help-all

# Category-specific help
make help-build       # Build and development targets
make help-package     # Package creation targets
make help-deps        # Dependency management targets
make help-service     # Service management targets
make help-docker      # Docker targets
make help-config      # Configuration management targets
make help-platform    # Platform-specific targets
```

## Docker Infrastructure

### Multi-Platform Support

The Docker setup supports multiple Linux distributions and architectures:

- **Distributions**: Ubuntu, CentOS, Alpine Linux
- **Architectures**: x86_64, arm64, armv7

### Build Profiles

```bash
# Development environment
docker-compose --profile dev up dev

# Runtime container
docker-compose --profile runtime up simple-utcd

# Build for specific distribution
docker-compose --profile build build build-ubuntu
docker-compose --profile build build build-centos
docker-compose --profile build build build-alpine
```

### Automated Building

Use the build script for automated cross-platform building:

```bash
# Build for all distributions
./scripts/build-docker.sh -d all

# Build for specific distribution
./scripts/build-docker.sh -d ubuntu

# Clean build cache
./scripts/build-docker.sh --clean
```
